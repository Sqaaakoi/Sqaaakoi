### I successfully pretend to know what the code I'm writing actually does.

## About me

- My pronouns are **they/them** üíõü§çüíúüñ§
- I sometimes make **Minecraft mods** for fun.
- I mostly program in **Java** and occasionally **JavaScript**, due to what I make.


## Projects that I'm currently working on

#### Native Decorations

<img align="right" src="images/2022-01-23_01.00.09.png" width=384>

A Minecraft mod that adds some decorations such as bushes, rocks, piles of logs and more to your worlds.

More is coming soon, such as re-adding the paeonia, and a few biomes too.

Here's a screenshot of the features, such as those rocks, log piles, and a "Big Oak Forest" biome.

(Big Oak Biome is intentionally designed to bring back Beta-like nostalgia.)

<sub><sup>Seed is `-5526793799177641198`, Version of mod is `0.2`, and time is `4000` ticks<br></sup></sub>

#### Custom minecraft launcher

I'm making a custom Minecraft launcher using Electron sometime soon.

Here's some ideas for it that I have.

- Modular

- Better account system

- Built-in locally stored repository of mods and resource pocks

- Simple format for sharing modpacks

- Better compatibility between launcher and mods running on the client

- A skin changer that automatically detects what model to use, because **I'm tired of going on public Minecraft servers and seeing people who have applied an Alex model skin to the Steve model. It genuinely really annoys me. (Maybe I'll make a client-side mod that automatically fixes other players skins that are displayed to show the correct model.)**

## You should also know...

- Don't contact me about jobs.

- I really hate NFTs and anything cryptocurrency related. It's been ruined by power hungry GPU mining and being a scam. You can't fix that.

- I sometimes store some of my repositories on my NAS and only push them to GitHub as a mirror. I'll try my best to accept PRs.
